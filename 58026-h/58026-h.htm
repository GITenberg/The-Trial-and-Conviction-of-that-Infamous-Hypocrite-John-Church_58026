JOHN CHURCH.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Indictment charged, &ldquo;That
the Defendant, late of the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth, in the
county of Surrey, on the 26th day of September, in the
fifty-seventh year of the reign of George the Third, with force
and arms, at the parish aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, in
and upon one Adam Foreman, in the peace of God and our said Lord
the King, then and there being, did make an assault, and him, the
said Adam Foreman, then and there did beat, wound, and ill treat,
so that his life was greatly despaired of, with intent, that most
horrid and detestable crime, (among Christians not to be named,)
with the said Adam Foreman, against the order of nature, then and
there feloniously, wickedly, and devilishly, to commit and do, to
the great displeasure of Almighty God, to the great damage of the
said Adam Foreman, and against the peace,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>The
second count charged a common assault.</p>
<p>The Defendant pleaded <span class="smcap">Not
Guilty</span>.</p>

class="smcap">Marryatt</span> and Mr. <span
class="smcap">Bolland</span>; Solicitor, Mr. <span

<p>Counsel for the Defendant&mdash;Mr. <span

<p>The Jury being sworn:&mdash;Mr. <span
class="smcap">Borland</span> opened the indictment, as
follows&mdash;</p>
<p>May it please your Lordship, Gentlemen of the Jury&mdash;The
Defendant, John Church, stands indicted for a misdemeanour.&nbsp;
He has pleaded Not Guilty, and your charge is to inquire whether
he be Guilty or Not Guilty.&nbsp; Hearken to the evidence.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Marryatt</i> then stated the case on the part of the
Prosecution; after which the court proceeded to call witnesses:
the first witness called was</p>
<h3>ADAM FOREMAN <i>sworn</i>.</h3>
<p><i>Examined by Mr. Bolland</i>.&mdash;Will be twenty the first
day of December next.&nbsp; Is an apprentice to Patrick, the
potter, of Vauxhall.&nbsp; Has <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>been with him about five years.&nbsp;
Knows the Defendant, John Church, by sight.&nbsp; Has known him
about two or three years.&nbsp; Church is a preacher.&nbsp; He,
Witness, attended the congregation in the Chapel where Church
preaches and has often seen him.&nbsp; Witness sleeps generally
at his father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There are occasions upon which
witness sleeps at his master&rsquo;s house when he goes out of
town.&nbsp; Church lived by his chapel, in St. George&rsquo;s
Fields, the Borough-Road.&nbsp; Came to take up his abode at Mr.
Patrick&rsquo;s the 25th of September, he came to sleep there
that night.&nbsp; Witness slept there that night.&nbsp; Does not
know whether he (Church) had been there before.&nbsp; Cannot say
whether he had seen him there before.&nbsp; Knows that he slept
there on the 25th September, and that he, witness, was
there.&nbsp; Witness&rsquo;s master that night was out of town;
but where he cannot say.&nbsp; Mr. Church, witness&rsquo;s
mistress, the children, and the two maid servants, slept in the
house that night.&nbsp; There was no other man in the house
except himself and Church.&nbsp; Witnesses bed-room was the front
parlour on the first floor over the kitchen.&nbsp; It is not a
bed-room in common in the house.&nbsp; Witness slept there,
because there was no other bed-room that he could sleep in.&nbsp;
There was a temporary bed, therefore, put up for him there.&nbsp;
Witness retired to rest about one o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The reason
for his being up so late was because there was a kiln burning,
and he (witness) was obliged to sit up to let the man into the
kiln when he came.&nbsp; It was necessary for him to sit up to
attend that kiln, and to give the key to the man, Thomas
West.&nbsp; Witness went to bed about one
o&rsquo;clock,&mdash;went to sleep directly he went to bed.&nbsp;
Had not been asleep more than half an hour before he was awoke by
some one putting his hands under the bed clothes, and laying hold
of his private parts very tight.&nbsp; Witness put his hand out
of the bed-clothes, and <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>caught hold of him and asked him who
he was? and laid hold of him, as near as he could guess, by the
upper part of his arm; felt lower down, and found by the sleeve
that he had got a man&rsquo;s shirt on; found the wrist was
buttoned; knows very well it was a man; could not tell that from
the feel of the flesh.&nbsp; Witness was here asked by <i>Lord
Ellenborough</i> by what circumstance? and answered because he
had got a man&rsquo;s shirt on.&nbsp; The person, in answer to
what he said, answered&mdash;&ldquo;Adam, don&rsquo;t you know
me?&nbsp; I am your mistress,&rdquo; in a faint voice, like a
woman; it was not the voice of his mistress, Mrs. Patrick;
witness knew the voice directly he heard it; it was Mr.
Church&rsquo;s voice; Church fled the room directly, that is he
went out in a hurried step.&nbsp; Witness then got out of bed,
and put on his small clothes and shoes, and went to the man up at
the kiln.&nbsp; As he opened the door witness saw by the lamp
that it was Mr. Church, and he had only his shirt on.&nbsp; The
lamp that enabled witness to see the person of Church is outside
of the front street door, on the terrace.&nbsp; The lamp throws a
light through the fan-light of the hall door.&nbsp; Witness was
here asked by <i>Lord Ellenborough</i> whether the lamp was at
the street door? and he answered, yes.&nbsp; It is a parish lamp;
not one of the new lights; nor a gas light.&nbsp; Question by
<i>Lord Ellenborough</i>&mdash;Where were you standing at the
time?&mdash;I was getting up, my lord.&nbsp; Witness went out of
his room.&nbsp; In answer to a question by <i>Lord
Ellenborough</i>, witness answered, he saw it was Church by the
lamp at the street door.&nbsp; Witness was then in bed, sitting
up; had not then left his bed; did not open the door; Church did
that.&nbsp; Witness saw him go out through that door; and then
observed that he had a shirt on.&nbsp; The shirt or dress of a
man is much shorter than that of a woman, and, therefore, he must
have seen whether it was a shirt or a <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>shift.&nbsp; It was the shirt of a man
witness is sure.&nbsp; Did not see his face at all; his
(Church&rsquo;s) back was towards witness.&nbsp; When he was
gone, witness got up and put on his small clothes and shoes, and
went into the pottery to get the man to come up to the house;
told Thomas West of it.&nbsp; Witness was here asked by <i>Lord
Ellenborough</i> whether West was in the pottery?&mdash;and
answered, he was; it was the Thomas West that was in the pottery
before witness went to bed.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney</i>.&mdash;The person, whoever
it was, opened the door and went out, afterwards shut the door
after him.&nbsp; Saw him when he opened the door.&nbsp; There was
no light in the room.&nbsp; The light came from a lamp on the
Terrace.&nbsp; The lamp is between five and six yards from the
door on the Terrace.&nbsp; The Terrace on which witness&rsquo;s
master&rsquo;s house is situated, is a row of houses raised above
the road.&nbsp; The lamp is upon the Terrace opposite the
door.&nbsp; About five or six yards from the door.&nbsp; The
light which it gives to the passage is through the fan-light over
the door.&nbsp; Did not see the face of the person.&nbsp; Saw
that the person had a shirt on.&nbsp; Was rather alarmed, waked
out of his sleep in this way.&nbsp; It was not long about.&nbsp;
Witness don&rsquo;t know how long he (Church) had been there
before witness awoke.&nbsp; Witness went directly to West, who
directly came with him and searched the house for thieves.&nbsp;
Did not know whether any body had got in or not.&nbsp; Looked at
every chamber-door in the house except Mr. Church&rsquo;s and
witness&rsquo;s mistress&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Looked at the door of Mr.
Church and that of his mistress, but did not open them.&nbsp;
They were both of them shut.&nbsp; Did not find any door
open.&nbsp; Looked at all the doors in the house, and found them
all shut.&nbsp; The maid servant&rsquo;s door was on the
jar.&nbsp; All the other doors were shut.&nbsp; After that
witness and West searched the house all over.&nbsp; West stopped
while <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the
witness put on the remainder of his clothes, witness then went
back with West to the pottery, after having locked the
door.&nbsp; Told West this story directly, told him that Mr.
Church came down into his (witness&rsquo;s) room and behaved in a
very indecent manner, that he had laid hold of his private parts,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Did not search the house for thieves in particular;
but searched if any body was in any of the rooms.&nbsp; <i>Mr.
Bolland</i> here said, I asked you before whether you did not
search the house for thieves; and you answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
are you right or wrong in that?&mdash;I asked you before whether
you and he did not search the house for thieves, and you told me
that you did?&mdash;Witness answered, we searched the house: we
looked all over it, to see if there was any body in any of the
rooms, but not for thieves in particular.&nbsp; Witness did not
think of thieves, because he knew who it was.&nbsp; Did not go
into the maid servants&rsquo; room; only looked in; having found
the door open, looked in.&nbsp; The two maids slept in that room;
one is witness&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; The door being ajar, witness
pushed it in a little, and saw they were abed.&nbsp; Did not
speak to them.</p>
<p><i>Re-examined by Mr. Bolland</i>.&mdash;Witness did not
search the house for thieves because he knew who the persons
was.&nbsp; The reason of his searching the house was because he
wished to be quite right before he made the accusation against
Mr. Church.&nbsp; Witness and West found there was no other man
in the house but Mr. Church.&nbsp; There was not any door or
window open at which any other man could have come in.&nbsp; The
light from the Terrace struck through the fan-light or window
over the door.&nbsp; It gives a pretty fair light to the hall, it
shews a little light up the stairs.&nbsp; It was at the time the
person opened the door and went out that witness got this view of
his person.</p>
<p><i>Examined by Lord Ellenborough</i>.&mdash;<a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Did not hear
Church when he first came into the room.&nbsp; Was awakened by
the application of his hand to witness&rsquo;s person.&nbsp; He
was standing upon the floor.&nbsp; Witness has not any difficulty
in hearing.&nbsp; Witness did not call to him by name, or give
him to understand that he knew who he was.&nbsp; Witness saw his
(Church&rsquo;s) back as he went out of the room.&nbsp; It
appeared to be the height of Mr. Church.&nbsp; Cannot say what
height he is.&nbsp; He had a night-cap.&nbsp; Cannot exactly say
whether it was a man&rsquo;s night-cap or no.&nbsp; Thinks it was
a handkerchief tied round his head.&nbsp; Cannot tell what sort
of handkerchief it was.&nbsp; When witness and West searched the
house and examined the different doors they went to Mr.
Church&rsquo;s door, but did not touch it, nor did they go
in.&nbsp; West wanted to go into the room and pull him out.&nbsp;
When West wanted to putt him out, witness did not call to him
because he was afraid of disturbing his mistress; she would have
been very much alarmed.&nbsp; Church never had any conversation
with witness, nor did he ever make any overture of this sort to
him before this time.&nbsp; There was nothing particular in his
manner or conduct towards witness before this time.&nbsp; Witness
has not spoken to him at all since.&nbsp; Has attended before a
Magistrate with him; spoke in his presence there, but not to him;
did not hear him speak before the Magistrate.&nbsp; He did not
speak at all before the Magistrate.&nbsp; Witness gave the same
account before the Magistrate that he has now done here.&nbsp;
Did not know whether it was a handkerchief or a night-cap that
was upon his head.&nbsp; There are not any other circumstances
from which he, witness, collected that it was a man.&nbsp; The
hand did not continue upon witness&rsquo;s person after he awaked
at all.&nbsp; The hand was withdrawn then.&nbsp; He said that he
was witness&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp; By the height of the person
he saw, witness could ascertain <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>whether it was or was not the height
of his mistress, or any of the female part of the house; Mr.
Church was a great deal bigger than any body there; witness does
not think he is quite six foot; he is a tallish stout man.&nbsp;
There was light enough by the lamp that witness has spoken of to
see the outline of the man so as to be able to say that he was a
tall person.&nbsp; Mrs. Patrick is a very little woman, quite a
different person from the person witness saw in the room.&nbsp;
The maid, who slept in the room with witness&rsquo;s sister, was
about as tall as witness&mdash;(<i>The Witness was about five
feet seven</i>)&mdash;not quite so tall.&nbsp; Witness was sure
it was not her.&mdash;<i>The Witness withdrew</i>.</p>
<h3>THOMAS WEST, <i>sworn</i>.</h3>
<p><i>Examined by Mr. Marryatt</i>.&nbsp; Is workman to Mr.
Patrick, the Potter.&nbsp; On the morning of the 26th September
last relieved Adam Foreman at the kiln.&nbsp; It was about half
past twelve o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Went to the pottery to relieve
him.&nbsp; Foreman left witness shortly afterwards, for the
purpose of going to bed.&nbsp; It was about an hour before
witness saw him again, when witness did see him again he was only
part dressed.&nbsp; He had on his small-clothes, his shoes, and
one-stocking.&nbsp; He came to witness in a very great fright,
and bid him light his candle; he appeared very much alarmed, and
bid him light his candle, and come along with him up to the
house.&nbsp; He told witness, as they were going along the
garden, that Mr. Church has been to him and behaved in a very
indecent manner.&nbsp; Did not explain how.&nbsp; He unlocked the
door and witness went into the house with him; it was the back
door of the house; the outer door; the garden door.&nbsp; When
they got to the house he went and put the remainder of his cloths
on and they went and searched every room in the house, beginning
at the bottom and going to the top, except witness&rsquo;s
mistress&rsquo;s room and Mr. <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Church&rsquo;s; they went into all
the rooms except Mr. Church&rsquo;s and Mrs.
Patrick&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Did not open the door of either of those
two rooms.&nbsp; When they came to Mr. Church&rsquo;s door
witness said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and pull him out; shall
I?&rdquo;&nbsp; The lad said, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; for fear of
disturbing his mistress.&nbsp; Upon that observation of the
lad&rsquo;s, about disturbing his mistress, witness forbore going
into the room.&nbsp; Foreman came along with witness into the
pottery; became down stairs, locked the back door, and staid with
witness the whole of the remainder of the night; he returned with
witness to the pottery, and staid till the morning; searched all
the rooms of the house, to see if there was any other person in
the place; did not find any window or door open, at which any
body could have got into the house; they were all close and
fastened.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by the Common-Serjeant</i>.&mdash;When
Foreman came to witness, he told him that Mr. Church had been
there; but did not explain what he had done; is quite sure of
that.</p>
<p><i>Lord Ellenborough</i>.&mdash;What words did he
use?&mdash;He only told me that Mr. Church had behaved in a very
indecent manner to him.</p>
<p>Witness had never any intimation that there were thieves in
the house; did not go to search for thieves in the house.&nbsp;
When Foreman told him that Mr. Church had behaved in a very
indecent manner to him, witness went to see if there was any
other person in the place.&nbsp; Foreman did not tell witness he
believed there were thieves in the house.&nbsp; Witness is quite
sure Foreman did not explain in what way Church behaved to
him.&nbsp; He did not say any thing like&mdash;That he came to
his bed-side and laid his hand on his private parts.&nbsp; This
was on the night of the 25th of September; witness afterwards
went before the magistrate, at the same time with Foreman, the
apprentice.&nbsp; To Union Hall.&nbsp; Foreman did not, <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>in the course
of the morning, when staying with witness, and after he had been
to the house, tell witness what Church had done to him, and that
he had laid has hand upon his private parts; never told him so,
from first to last.&nbsp; Witness cannot say at what time it was
that he went before the Magistrate with Foreman; cannot say the
day of the month; it was some time afterwards; believes it was
six or seven weeks after; the lad then went with his father; the
lad generally slept at home at his father&rsquo;s; his
father&rsquo;s is about a quarter of a mile from his
master&rsquo;s; he slept at his father&rsquo;s the next night but
one; it was not till about six or seven weeks after that, they
went to the justice; witness did not communicate with Mr. Patrick
upon the subject before he went to the justice.</p>
<h3>MR. PATRICK <i>sworn</i>.</h3>
<p><i>Examined by Mr. Bolland</i>.&mdash;Is a potter at
Vauxhall.&nbsp; The boy, Foreman, has been with him ever since he
has been in the pottery business, between five and six
years.&nbsp; He only slept in witness&rsquo;s house occasionally;
that is, whenever he (witness) leaves town; and then he has the
key of the pottery, there being no other male in the house.&nbsp;
Witness was absent from home on the 25th of September last.&nbsp;
The boy on that occasion was to steep in his (witness&rsquo;s)
house.&nbsp; The bed that had been put up for him was a chair-bed
in the front parlour; a temporary bed for a nurse
occasionally.&nbsp; Witness knows the Defendant, John
Church.&nbsp; He is a Baptist preacher.&nbsp; Witness first
became acquainted with him when he came to Vauxhall.&nbsp;
Witness attends his chapel, and so became acquainted with
him.&nbsp; His residence is adjoining the chapel.&nbsp; In the
month of September he came to sleep at witness&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; Witness put a bed up for him.&nbsp; He had
complained of ill health occasionally; and thinking that he was
ill, witness asked him out of friendship to take a <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>bed at his
(witness&rsquo;s) house, supposing that the air would be of
service to him.&nbsp; Does not live very close the river.&nbsp;
Witness was out from home on the 25th of September.&nbsp; Did not
return till the evening of the 26th.&nbsp; The boy, Foreman, made
a communication to him the next morning when he saw him.&nbsp;
Witness returned on the evening of the 26th.</p>
<p><i>By Lord Ellenborough</i>.&mdash;Then it was the day but one
after, namely, the morning of the 27th that the boy made the
communication to you?&mdash;Yes; my Lord.</p>
<p>Did not see Foreman on the night of witness&rsquo;s
return&mdash;not to speak with him.&nbsp; On the morning of the
27th he made the communication to witness respecting this
transaction.&nbsp; Witness told Foreman he was extremely sorry
for what had happened.&nbsp; Witness had had many applications
from the congregation, to whom he made it known.&nbsp; It was in
consequence of the information they had received from general
report, that they applied to witness for authentic
information.&nbsp; Several of the congregation made those
applications.&nbsp; There was a meeting upon the subject.&nbsp;
In consequence of applications made to witness from the
congregation, he went to the Defendant, Church.&nbsp; Thinks it
was on the 9th of October.&nbsp; There had not before that been a
meeting of the congregation, at which witness was present.&nbsp;
Did not take any steps between the 27th of September to see
Church, and the 9th of October, upon the subject.&nbsp; That was
the first communication witness had with Church upon the
subject.&nbsp; Church said to him, he took it extremely kind of
witness in calling upon him.&nbsp; Witness told him he might take
it as he pleased; that he did not come willingly, but that some
of his congregation thought that witness ought to see him on the
business.&nbsp; Patrick cannot say Church, appeared to be
apprized of the subject before witness began; but believes he was
apprized <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>from what afterwards occurred.&nbsp; Witness told him he
(witness) waited upon him, having seen a letter wherein he denied
three particular points of the boy&rsquo;s statement; and witness
wished to know what those points were.&nbsp; He said that he
denied having hold of the boy, or the boy having told of him; or
he, Church, saying that he was the boy&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp; He
admitted he was in the room, but denied laying hold of the
boy&rsquo;s private parts; did not state any reason for being in
the room at all.&nbsp; He said that he denied three particular
points, two of which witness had already named.&nbsp; The other
was something that did not occur to witness to be important, and
which he did not take any notice of, consequently does not
remember it.&nbsp; Witness told him that, of these two points
mentioned, the boy was positive, and witness had no reason to
doubt any thing that the boy had said, as he had never known him
to tell a lie.&nbsp; He said that he was sorry for it, because
that confirmed <i>antient reports</i>; witness told him it did
so; and, of course, that now he should believe all that he had
heard heretofore.&nbsp; Witness then wished him a good
morning.&nbsp; Did not see him at any time afterwards to speak to
him; has seen him, but not spoken to him since.&nbsp; The letter
that witness had seen, which he spoke to Church about, was a
letter dated the 6th of October, addressed to a Mrs.
Hunter.&nbsp; Witness took an exact copy of it.&nbsp; Mr. Harmer
has it.&nbsp; Is that the copy?&nbsp; (<i>A paper put into the
witness&rsquo; hand</i>.)&nbsp; Yes; it is an exact copy.&nbsp;
Witness did not read that copy of the letter to Church; he had.
not the copy at that time; only told him he wished to know what
the three things were which he could deny, as asserted by the
boy; does not recollect the third point; it is not
material.&nbsp; He admitted being in the room, but denied the
laying hold,&mdash;he said, &ldquo;I was in the room; but I did
not lay hold of the boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Did not say <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>why he was in
the room.&nbsp; Witness returned the letter of the 6th of October
to Mrs. Hunter.&nbsp; He got it from Mrs. Hunter, and to Mrs.
Hunter he returned it.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney</i>.&mdash;Meant to say that
Church said distinctly to witness that he was in the room.&nbsp;
Did not mention to any person, after he had see Mr. Church, that
he was not implicated in the affair at all.&nbsp; Never said any
such thing.&nbsp; Did not give any person an account of the
conversation you had with him, and accompany that account with
this observation, &ldquo;He is not at all
implicated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Thomas went to the door of Mr.
Church with witness.&nbsp; Thomas is no friend of
witness&rsquo;s; witness had only seen him at the door.&nbsp; It
was <i>his</i> wife and witness&rsquo;s that wished witness to
make the application to Mr. Church.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas went with
him as far as the door, but did not go in with him.&nbsp; Witness
told him briefly what had transpired; it was very short what did
transpire.&nbsp; He told Mr. Thomas what had transpired at the
interview with Mr. Church, when he came out.&nbsp; Think he told
Mr. Thomas that Mr. Church admitted having been in the room, but
is not positive as to that point; knows he told him that Mr.
Church said he did not lay hold of the boy.&nbsp; Did not answer,
on Mr. Thomas asking, &ldquo;Well, is there any thing against Mr.
Church, or not.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No; he is not at all
implicated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never told him, directly or indirectly,
that there was nothing to implicate Mr. Church.&nbsp; Witness did
say he would prosecute Mr. Church because he had said disgraceful
things of witness&rsquo;s wife, but not for this crime, but for
defamation of his wife&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t know
that he ever told Mr. Thomas so, but believes he said that, or
words to that effect, to other persons.&nbsp; Did not mention
that, amongst other things, on that very morning that he had the
interview with Mr. Church; some other time he might.</p>

HUNTER <i>sworn</i>.<br />
<i>Examined by Mr. Marryatt</i>.</h3>
<p>Is an attendant amongst the congregation, and a hearer of Mr.
Church.&nbsp; Received a letter in the beginning of the month of
October, but there was no name to it.&nbsp; There was no place of
abode given, nor any thing except the day of the month; could not
tell from whom it came; gave it to Mr. Patrick&rsquo;s daughter,
who gave it to her father; it was returned to witness again, who
took no further notice of it.&nbsp; Witness had a subp&oelig;na
<i>duces tecum</i> so produce it, but was impossible to produce
it.&nbsp; After the letter was returned witness took no further
notice of it, but put it into a drawer; knows no more than his
Lordship what is become of it; looked for it on the Thursday
morning before she came, but could find no scraps of it; was not
able to find it; was wholly unable to find it; witness searched
diligently to find it; is convinced there was no name to
it.&nbsp; Has seen Mr. Church&rsquo;s hand-writing, and has seen
it written in a different hand, not always alike, but sometimes
very different; not to say exactly two different hands, but such
a difference in the same hand-writing that she would hardly think
it the same; has seen it so different, at times, that she should
not at all times, think, it was the same; thinks it was
Church&rsquo;s hand-writing, but could not be positive, as there
was no name to it; cannot say whether it was or was not; it is
not in witness&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; Witness believed, at that
time, that it was his hand-writing, and believes it still.&nbsp;
When she opened it she was very much struck with the similarity,
for it had very much the appearance of his hand-writing; but, as
their was not a signature, could not be certain.&nbsp; It had the
appearance of his handwriting.&nbsp; Witness&rsquo;s belief now,
whether it was or was not his hand-writing, is exactly this same
now as it was then.&nbsp; Cannot say.&nbsp; She firmly believes
it was his hand-writing, because <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>it was not signed.&nbsp; Did not
communicate it to any body but Mr. Patrick.&nbsp; Communicated to
Mr. Patrick that she had received a letter from Mr. Church.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by the Common Serjeant</i>.&nbsp; The search
which witness made for this letter was not until last
Thursday.&nbsp; Witness has no reason to believe that it is in
her house, for she did not leave a draw or place unsearched.</p>
<p><i>Lord Ellenborough</i>.&mdash;As far as evidence can go of
the loss of an original letter, to let in the copy, we have it in
this case; for I asked her whether she made diligent search after
the original, and she says, she has made diligent search.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Patrick examined again by Mr. Marryatt</i>.&mdash;Was
acquainted in October last with the hand-writing of Mr.
Church.&nbsp; The letter from which he made this copy, and which
he returned to Mrs. Hunter, was, in his belief, the handwriting
of Mr. Church.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Marryatt</i>.&mdash;Now, my Lord, I propose reading
this copy of the letter in question.</p>
<p>The following letter was then read in evidence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>October</i> 6,
1816.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Hunter,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart is already too much affected.&nbsp; Your
letter only adds affliction to my bonds.&nbsp; But I
forbear.&nbsp; I would have called on you this morning, but I was
too low in mind to speak to any friend but Jesus!&nbsp;
<i>There</i> I am truly comfortable.&nbsp; Pardon me; but I make
no remarks on what you have been told.&nbsp; I must bear it,
though I am able to contradict <i>three things</i> I would rather
not.&nbsp; I am only grieved that dear Mrs. P. whom I really
loved, that she should try to injure me in the estimation of
those who are real friends to my dear children.&nbsp; The thought
affects me.&nbsp; Why hurt my poor family?&nbsp; But I am too
much depressed to enlarge.&nbsp; I shall never forget their
kindness.&nbsp; God will reward them, as he has <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>many who have
dealt well to me.&nbsp; But he will resent cruelty in those who
have and are still trying to degrade me.&nbsp; Mrs. P. will live
to see it.&nbsp; Dear Mrs. Hunter, I am grieved at heart I cannot
relieve your mind.&nbsp; I am truly sorry to lose you as a
hearer, because your soul has been blest; and you know both the
plague of the heart and the value of Jesus.&nbsp; May he be
increasingly present to you in his person, love, and grace!&nbsp;
Farewell, my dear kind friend!&nbsp; The Lord Jesus will reward
you for your love to me, and your kindness to mine.&nbsp; God is
not unrighteous to forget your work of faith and labour of
love.&nbsp; With many tears I write this.&nbsp; May we meet in
glory, when no enemy shall distress my mind, nor sin nor death
shall part us more!&nbsp; I need not remind my dear friend that I
am a <i>Child</i> of <i>Peculiar Providence</i>; and that
<i>heart</i> of eternal love, and that <i>arm</i> of invincible
power has protected me&mdash;has called me to himself; and for
every act of straying, will correct me with <i>his own hand</i>,
but will resent <i>every other hand</i>, sooner or later.&nbsp;
This you will live to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Adieu</i>, <i>dear friend</i>, <i>accept the

<i>And the best wishes of a heart sincere</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Your&rsquo;s, truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Till we shall meet
above.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Mr. Marryatt</i>.&mdash;My Lord, that is the case on the
part of the prosecution.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Gurney</span>, on the part of the
Defendant, most eloquently addressed the Jury, endeavouring, by
observations, to throw some doubt on the testimony of the
prosecutor, because he had searched the house after the attack:
this, the learned Counsel urged, evinced an uncertainty in the
boy&rsquo;s mind, as to the person who had been in his
room.&nbsp; That his conduct was unaccountable, in not going into
Church&rsquo;s room and questioning him, when he had West to
assist him.&nbsp; The learned Counsel also commented on the delay
which had taken place before any complaint had been made to a
magistrate, and contended, that this circumstance threw <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>discredit on
the prosecutor&rsquo;s case, and concluded by observing, that if
his client was guilty, his crime was greatly aggravated, because
he, as a Minister of the Gospel, was bound to set an example of
morality, and intreated the Jury, that as the offence was of so
shocking and heinous a nature as to render it improbable that a
man in Mr. Church&rsquo;s station could have committed it, that,
before they consigned him to eternal infamy, they would be fully
satisfied that the testimony against him was unquestionable and
conclusive.</p>
<p><i>The first witness called for the Defendant was</i></p>
<h3>Mr. JOHN THOMAS <i>sworn</i>.</h3>
<p><i>Examined by the Common Serjeant</i>.&mdash;His name is John
Thomas; lives in Prospect-place, West&rsquo;s Square, St.
George&rsquo;s Fields; is an appraiser and undertaker; has known
Mr. Church a long time; is one of his hearers; is acquainted with
Mr. Patrick, but not till the report was made respecting Mr.
Church; cannot say he knew him as one of the congregation
attending, Mr. Church; was with Mr. Patrick when he went to Mr.
Church&rsquo;s house, the 9th of October, a few days after the
report; did not go into the house with him, staid outside; had
learnt from Mr. Patrick that he was going to Mr. Church&rsquo;s
upon the subject of this business; he called upon witness, at his
house, to go with him, and told witness he was going to Mr.
Church&rsquo;s upon the business of this inquiry; indeed, it was
witness&rsquo;s request that he should; Mrs. Thomas went to speak
to his wife, and it was at Mrs. Thomas&rsquo;s request and Mrs.
Patrick&rsquo;s that he went; he seemed to be a long while in
Church&rsquo;s house, not much less than an hour; it was near an
hour; when he came out witness put some questions to him,
respecting what had passed between him and Mr. Church; witness
asked him what Mr. Church had said; he said that Mr. Church did
not say anything; that he seemed very much confounded on account
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of the
cause, he supposed, but he said nothing about it, that it would
be injurious to the cause of God; he did not say the <i>cause of
God</i>, witness only supposed he meant the cause of God; did not
use the words &ldquo;cause of God;&rdquo; he said Mr. Church
seemed very much confounded or confused.&nbsp; The rest is all
imagination of witness&rsquo;s; both imagined alike; don&rsquo;t
know that these were exactly the words; cannot call to his
(witness) mind what he (Patrick) did say, but it was conjectured
the cause of God, and which they heard afterwards was abused
abroad; does not recollect all that passed; Mr. Church had not
said anything to Mr. Patrick which Mr. Patrick related to
witness; he said Mr. Church seemed very much confused; witness
asked Mr. Patrick &ldquo;what do you mean; why; if you know
anything against the man, did you not charge him with it;&rdquo;
he said he did not know; he was not the person; he (Patrick)
said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know: I am not so proper a person as
you,&rdquo; or words to the same effect.&nbsp; Witness said to
him, &ldquo;What did he (meaning Church) say respecting the
report respecting this transaction?&rdquo;&nbsp; Witness said to
Mr. Patrick, says he, &ldquo;what did he say respecting the
acknowledging the report&rdquo;&mdash;that is, what did Mr.
Church say to Mr. Patrick about acknowledging the report that had
gone abroad respecting him.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;It was
false.&rdquo;&nbsp; Patrick said that the report was false.&nbsp;
Witness never saw Church upon the subject.&nbsp; When Patrick
made witness the answer, he understood that answer to be, that
Patrick himself said the report was false.&nbsp; Witness then put
other questions to Mr. Patrick.&nbsp; He said, says he, what
answer did Mr. Church give respecting its having been reported
that he was in liquor&mdash;that he made an excuse that he was in
liquor?&nbsp; Mr. Patrick said it was false.&nbsp; He said there
had been a great deal of exaggeration.&nbsp; Did not after this
put any question to Mr. Patrick, whether he, Mr. Patrick, thought
that <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Mr.
Church was implicated in the transaction or not.&nbsp; Witness
put these words to him&mdash;&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;you did nothing!&nbsp; Did Mr. Church acknowledge nothing
to you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Sir,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;he
did not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he said Mr. Church had not mentioned a
word about it.&nbsp; Did not make any observation to him, or he
to witness.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t recollect any thing in particular
witness said, says he, &ldquo;As you can bring nothing against
him, let us pray for him, and if he had the least idea of such a
thing; and as you say you cannot bring any thing home to him, and
can&rsquo;t prove any thing, that is all we can do.&nbsp; Let us
pray that he may not be guilty of such sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lord Ellenborough</i>.&mdash;Did you say, pray for him, if
he was under any such temptation?&mdash;Yes; pray for him, if he
was under any such temptation.</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick did not after that deliver any opinion to witness
whether he thought Church was implicated in the transaction or
not.&nbsp; Did not at any other time see him, and hear him say
any thing about this transaction.&nbsp; Nothing more passed at
this meeting than what witness has told.&nbsp; Witness afterwards
recollected, and asked pardon: he met Patrick in June last,
coming over Waterloo-bridge.&nbsp; Did not at first know him; and
he spoke to witness, and he said, &ldquo;My name is
Patrick.&rdquo;&nbsp; Witness said, &ldquo;Mr. Patrick, why what
are you doing with Mr. Church?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
says witness, &ldquo;I hear you have brought something else
against him: what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Lord Ellenborough</i>.&mdash;There is no contradiction of
Mr. Patrick in this.&nbsp; He was not asked to this (continuation
of the answer).&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Sir, I
should not have done it, but, that Mr. Church has spoken more
disrespectful things respecting Mrs. Patrick.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
said he should not have done it, but that Mr. Church had said
many disrespectful things of Mrs. Patrick.</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Marryatt</i>.&mdash;Believes it was
the Sabbath after the <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>27th of September that he first heard
of this.&nbsp; It was within two or three days after.&nbsp; Heard
of the report two or three days after the thing happened.&nbsp;
Witness was desirous that Mr. Patrick should call on Mr.
Church.&nbsp; He did so, at witness&rsquo;s desire.&nbsp;
Believes Mr. Patrick brought the boy to him, and offered to have
him brought face to face with Mr. Church.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick
called at witness&rsquo;s house in the course of the morning, and
he sent him, he said the boy was outside.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick did
not particularly wish witness to see the boy; believes he brought
the boy to go to Mr. Church&rsquo;s; witness was to go with him,
and, therefore, the boy followed.&nbsp; The boy staid outside the
door.&nbsp; He walked on the other side of the way, opposite to
where witness was.&nbsp; He waited whilst witness waited, they
both waited outside ready to go into Mr. Church&rsquo;s when they
were wanted.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick was to go in and hear what Mr.
Church had to say; and then they were to go in too.&nbsp; He took
the boy with him, in order that he might be taken in and see Mr.
Church face to face.&nbsp; Witness supposes that was his
intention.&nbsp; Witness had no particular acquaintance with Mr.
Church, was only one of his hearers, and thought it would be too
great a liberty for him to go to him.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick wanted
witness to go in alone to Mr. Church first.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
recollect any thing that he did.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t know any other
reason he had than that for bringing the boy.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
know that he said that that was his reason.&nbsp; He said he had
the boy there.&nbsp; Witness told Patrick he had no particular
interest in the business; had no intimacy with Mr. Church, except
hearing him: thought he had no business to be interested in the
knowledge of the fact, being only a hearer.&nbsp; Thought,
therefore, what his visit would be obtrusive; certainly had no
interest in it.&nbsp; Saw no necessity for going in and taking
the boy, as he, Church, did not acknowledge <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>himself
guilty of any thing bad.&nbsp; Did not examine the boy, it being
a delicate subject.&nbsp; If Mr. Church had confessed any thing,
witness should have it thought it his duty to take the boy and
have them face to face.&nbsp; Mr. Church not having confessed any
thing, he would not examine the boy; that was his reason for not
examining the boy.&nbsp; If he had confessed any thing witness
would have taken the boy to have them face to face; his object
was to take the boy and have them face to face, if Mr. Church
acknowledged the crime.&nbsp; When Mr. Patrick came out and said
that Mr. Church did not acknowledge any thing of it he did not
think it necessary to have them face to face.&nbsp; Never spoke
to the boy.&nbsp; Never asked the boy about this
transaction.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick never gave any opinion whether Mr.
Church was implicated in the transaction; but in answer to a
particular part of the transaction, he said that Mr. Church
asserted that it was false.&nbsp; Did not see the letter sent to
Mrs. Hunter; about the three points of the boy&rsquo;s statement
which Mr. Church said he was able to contradict.</p>
<h3>Mr. JAMES REEVES <i>sworn</i>.</h3>
<p><i>Examined by the Common Sergeant</i>.&nbsp; Was the Clerk
attending the magistrate when the charge was made before him;
must refer to the book&mdash;Witness produced a book to tell who
was the magistrate; it was the minute book in which the entered
the proceedings of the day.&nbsp; Mr. Serjeant Sellon appeared to
have been the Magistrate on the 19th November, as it appears by
the book.&nbsp; Being a charge misdemeanor no account was
committed to writing of what the witnesses said; it was merely a
note or entry of the names, as follows; &ldquo;Warrant for a
misdeameanor, parties appeared by the Officer, and ordered to
find bail.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Cross-examined by Mr. Marryatt</i>.&mdash;Mr. Serjeant
Sellon was the magistrate by whom the warrant was granted.&nbsp;
The oath was administered <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>before the warrant was granted; there
had been an <i>ex-parte</i> examination to grant the warrant on
the oath of the party;&mdash;that is in another book left behind;
does not know any thing of it.&nbsp; There is a deposition on
oath prior to the granting of the warrant.</p>
<p><i>Re-examined by the Common Serjeant</i>.&mdash;Don&rsquo;t
take the depositions in cases of misdemeanor in detail.&nbsp; Is
not aware of depositions taken in writing in any book which he
had not here; was not told to bring it.&nbsp; There was nothing
taken down in writing before the warrant was granted.&nbsp; After
the warrant was executed, and at the time of the examination,
when the Defendant was there, witness took no minutes further
than the names of the parties, and what he now produced.</p>
<h3>Mr. WOOD <i>sworn</i>.</h3>
<p><i>Examined by Mr. Gurney</i>.&mdash;Was present at the
examination of Mr. Church before the magistrate; is a hatter,
near the Elephant and Castle, in St. George&rsquo;s Fields; did
not take the testimony of witnesses down in writing.&nbsp;
Foreman, the boy, in the account he gave before the magistrate,
said he went out to the potter and told the potter that there
were thieves in the house, and that the potter and he said the
came to search the house.&nbsp; He was asked a question by Mr.
Sellon, whether or not he searched the room where Mr. Church
slept.&nbsp; He said, no, he did not search that room.&nbsp; Mr.
Sellon said, &ldquo;Why not search the room?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
answer he gave was, that the potter wished to break the door
open.&nbsp; Mr. Sellon said, &ldquo;Did you try the door, to see
whether it was open, before the potter talked of breaking it
open?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said, no; he did not wish to disturb his
mistress.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Gurney</i>.&mdash;My lord, this is the case of the
Defendant.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Marryatt</i> then replied to the Defendant&rsquo;s
case.</p>
<p><i>Lord Ellenborough</i> proceeded to sum up the evidence on
which he commented most ably.&nbsp; With respect to the up the
evidence, on which he commented most ably.&nbsp; With respect to
the <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>young
man searching the house, his Lordship said it shewed a precaution
which was highly creditable to the boy, who had also given a good
reason for not going into the Defendant&rsquo;s room, namely,
that it must have disturbed and alarmed his mistress at that
unseasonable hour of the night, and that as to the alleged delay,
this seemed to have arisen from the interference of the
Defendant&rsquo;s friends; but, although a considerable time
elapsed before the prosecutor went to a magistrate, it was clear
that he made instant complaint to West, and to his master.&nbsp;
His Lordship then adverted to the admission of the Defendant as
to being in the boy&rsquo;s room without assigning any reason or
motive, and his Lordship asked, what earthly purpose could the
Defendant have for visiting this youth in his bed-room in the
dead of the night? and, if no honest reason appeared, it was for
the jury to say whether the lad&rsquo;s account was not
irresistably confirmed by this admission.&nbsp; His Lordship read
the letter, before alluded to, throughout, and most emphatically
expressed his indignation at sacred names, which ought never to
be mentioned but with reverence, being used with disgusting
familiarity in such a shocking transaction.</p>
<p>The Jury almost instantly returned a verdict of <span
class="smcap">Guilty</span>, which gave universal satisfaction to
a crowded Court.&nbsp; The trial occupied four hours.</p>
<h2><i>LIFE OF JOHN CHURCH</i>.</h2>
<blockquote><p>The nearer to <span class="smcap">Church</span>
the further from <span class="smcap">God</span>!!&nbsp; <i>Old
English Proverb</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Jortin, in his <i>Adversaria</i>, very justly remarks,
that &ldquo;a sudden rise from a low station, as it sometimes
shews to advantage the virtuous and amiable qualities, which
could not exert themselves before, so it more frequently calls
forth and exposes to view, those spots of the soul which <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>lay lurking
in secret, cramped by penury, and veiled with
dissimulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>JOHN CHURCH, better known as the Obelisk Parson, it appears,
was abandoned by his parents, when he was scarcely six weeks old,
and left exposed in a basket, with little covering to protect him
from the inclemency of the weather, on the steps of St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Church, Holborn.&nbsp; In this pitiable state he
was found by the overseers of the parish, and sent to the
Foundling Hospital; and it was from this circumstance he derived
the name of <span class="smcap">Church</span>.&nbsp; Here he
remained until he was nine years old, when a complaint to the
Governor&rsquo;s having been made against him by the nurses that
he was addicted to improper and disgusting practices, it was
thought prudent to apprentice him out at that early age, in order
to prevent the morals of the boys being corrupted from so
dangerous an example.&nbsp; He must have quitted the hospital at
an earlier age than usual, from his evident illiteracy, and the
badness of his writing.&nbsp; In general the boys from this
institution are distinguished as good scholars.&nbsp; Church was
accordingly placed out as an apprentice to a carver and gilder,
in the neighbourhood of Blackfriar&rsquo;s Road; but before his
time of servitude had expired, he married, and abruptly quitted
his master.&nbsp; For a short period he followed his business,
and worked for a composition ornament maker, in
Tottenham-Court-road; but being of an artful disposition, of lazy
habits, and with much hypocritical cant, he at length succeeded
in imposing upon several religious persons his great anxiety and
desire to become a minister of the Gospel.&nbsp; It appears, he
commenced his <i>pretended</i> religious career, by taking upon
himself the office of a teacher of a sunday school, at that time
established in Tottenham Court-road.&nbsp; Thinking that
preaching was a more lucrative employment than that in which he
was engaged, this hypocritical wretch, together <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>with two
other young men, who were also candidates for the gown, hired a
garret in Compton-street, Soho, in order to acquire the method of
addressing a congregation with confidence.&nbsp; He made a rapid
progress in dissimulation, and even at this early period of his
religious studies, he laughed in his sleeve at the credulity and
ignorance of those persons who were induced to listen to his
<i>pious</i> harangues.&nbsp; An old chair was the substitute for
the pulpit.&nbsp; He now began, as he termed it, &ldquo;to gammon
the old women.&rdquo;&nbsp; Good luck procured him the notice of
old Mother Barr, of Orange-street, who being interested in his
behalf, allowed him the use of a room of her&rsquo;s, in which he
treated her and a few choice labourers in the field of piety,
with his rapturous discourses.&nbsp; From this he used to hold
forth more publicly.&nbsp; He became acquainted with one <span
class="smcap">Garnet</span>, of notorious memory, who procured
him the situation of a preacher at Banbury.&nbsp; It was at this
place that he first became obnoxious.&nbsp; But before we proceed
further, it may be necessary to inquire by what authority such a
man as <span class="smcap">Church</span> presumed to take upon
himself the functions of a minister of the gospel.&nbsp; A man so
profligate&mdash;so notoriously criminal&mdash;come forth to
instruct others in religion.&nbsp; It seems, the practice among
Dissenters is, that when any man feels a strong desire to become
a preacher, he communicates the same to several ministers, who
make a strict inquiry into his qualifications as to piety,
learning, morals, &amp;c. and if they find these established on
satisfactory evidence, they then confer on the candidate a sort
of ordination, without which he can have no authority to
officiate as a minister of the Gospel.&nbsp; It is evident he
must have played the hypocrite in a masterly style, as he did
receive an <i>ordination</i> at Banbury, in Oxfordshire.&nbsp;
But his <i>real</i> character soon made its appearance, from his
having made <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>several violent attempts upon some young men while at
the above place, he was driven out from thence, by the trustees
of the chapel in which he preached, and the magistrates, and
ordered never to shew his face there again.&nbsp; He hastily
decamped, leaving behind him his wife and children, and the
police-officers having been sent in pursuit of him, their
searches proved fruitless, and it was a long time before he was
heard of.&nbsp; He then threw off all controul, and acted <i>in
defiance of all the ordinances of the Dissenting Church</i>!
preaching doctrines tending to encourage licentiousness, and
foster the worst of passions.&nbsp; At Colchester he turned the
whole congregation against their minister.&nbsp; The mode of
healing the consciences of profligate men was practised by the
Romish Church before the Reformation, and when it flourished in
its rankest state of corruption&mdash;when indulgences for sins
to be committed, and pardons for sins past, were openly sold for
money.&nbsp; The manner in which the Obelisk Preacher conducts
the affairs of his chapel bears some resemblance to this
practice.&nbsp; He has filled his pockets, it appears, from the
money which he has raised by inflaming the passions, and exciting
hopes and fears; this <i>pretender</i> of piety has even
administered the sacrament to persons who were nearly intoxicated
with gin!&nbsp; It is said that Church belongs to that sect
called <span class="smcap">Antinomians</span>, which is thus
described by the Rev. John Evans, in his &ldquo;Sketch of the
Denominations of the Christian World:&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
Antinomian derives his name from <span class="smcap">Anti</span>
and <span class="smcap">Nomos</span>; simplifying, against, and a
<span class="smcap">Law</span>, his favourite tenet being, that
the law is not a rule of life to believers.&nbsp; It is not easy
to ascertain what he means by this position, but be seems to
carry the doctrine of imputed righteousness of Christ and
salvation faith, without works, to such lengths, as to injure, if
not wholly destroy, the obligation <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>to moral obedience.&nbsp;
Antinomianism may be traced to the period of the Reformation, and
its promulgator was John Agricola, originally a disciple of
Luther.&nbsp; The Papists, in their disputes with the Protestants
of that day, carried the merit of good works to an extravagant
length; and this induced some of their opponents to run into the
opposite extreme.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This sect (says the
Encyclop&aelig;dia) sprung up in England during the protectorate
of Oliver Cromwell, and extended the system of libertinism much
further than Agricola, the disciple of Luther.&nbsp; Some of
their teachers expressly maintained, that as the elect cannot
fall from grace nor forfeit the divine favour, the wicked actions
they commit are not really sinful, nor are they to be considered
as instances of their violation of the Divine Law; consequently,
they have no occasion to confess their sins, or to break them off
by repentance.&nbsp; According to them, it is one of the
essential and distinctive characters of the elect that they
cannot do any thing displeasing to God, or prohibited by
law.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may easily be inferred from such doctrine as
the above, the dreadful crime men may be induced to commit,
without the horrors of conscience or fear of punishment.&nbsp;
From his retreat in the country, it seems, he was called to use
his influence in town, by a man of his own disgraceful kind,
designated <i>Kitty Cambric</i>; and well known at the Swan, in
Vere-street.&nbsp; It is notorious from the public exposure of
the wretches, who were detected in this street, and brought to
punishment, that many of them assumed the name of women, and were
absolutely married together, and it appears Church was actually
the parson who performed the blasphemous mock ceremony of joining
them in the ties of &ldquo;<i>holy matrimony</i>,&rdquo; he being
nominated their <i>chaplain</i>.&nbsp; He now settled himself at
Chapel-court, in the Borough, when his old friend <i>Garrett</i>
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>publicly
charged him with a wicked and diabolical offence, as the law
says, &ldquo;not to be named amongst Christians,&rdquo; and he
was obliged to run away from the accusation.&nbsp; By some
fortuitous event he, at length, got possession of the Obelisk
Chapel, where he began again to deliver his abominable doctrines;
and several young men were obliged to leave him, in consequence
of his having used them in a manner too indecent to be mentioned
or hinted at.&nbsp; The first document we have is letter dated
March 7, 1810, from a person, at Banbury, named Hall, of which
the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Honoured Sir&mdash;in reply to your letter
concerning Mr. C. I can only inform you, there was a report
against him of a very scandalous nature; but how far his
culpability extends, it is quite out of my power to
determine.&nbsp; He was absent from hence when the rumour first
spread.&nbsp; The managers of our chapel took great pains to
inquire into the origin of such reports, and the result was, they
sent Mr. C. positive orders never, on any account, to return to
Banbury again; which advice he has hitherto wisely
observed.&nbsp; Now, sir, after giving you the above information,
I beg leave to conclude the subject by referring you to your own
comment hereon.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">(Signed) S. <span
class="smcap">Hall</span>.</p>
<p><i>Banbury</i>, <i>March</i> 7, 1817.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a letter from William Clark, of Ipswich, a young
man between 19 and 20 years of age, which contains an account of
attempts to horrid to be published.&nbsp; The written confession
(frightful indeed it is) of this poor simple young man, whose
mind was bewildered by the canting exhortations of Church; and
the whole of his statements corroborated by the oral testimony of
Mr. Wire, who resides at Colchester, and knows Clark very
well.&nbsp; The circumstances related by Clark would have
furnished ample grounds for a criminal prosecution had he made
his <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>complaint <i>immediately</i> after the <i>assault</i>
was committed:&mdash;but, suffering under the influence of
ignorance and fear, he kept it a secret too long, and afterwards
accepted of a pound note from Church.&nbsp; A case was laid
before two eminent barristers, to have their opinion whether such
a prosecution could be carried on with any prospect of
conviction.&nbsp; Their opinion, in writing, is, that after the
long concealment of a charge, a jury would pay no attention to
his evidence, unless he was confirmed in his story by other
evidence.</p>
<h3><i>Extract from the confession of William Clark</i>, <i>of
Ipswich</i>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having been called by Providence to
Colchester, I went to hear John Church preach in a barn, was
invited to Mr. Abbot&rsquo;s; was prevailed upon to sleep with
John Church; I did sleep with him three nights; after being
enticed to many <i>imprudencies</i>, I was under the necessity to
resist <i>certain attempts</i>, which, if I had complied with, I
am fearful must have ruined <i>both soul and body</i>: the crime
is <i>too horrid</i> to relate.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The peace of this poor lad&rsquo;s mind is completely
destroyed, so fatally has the event preyed upon him;&mdash;so far
as to fill the bosom of his aged father with such a spirit of
indignation and revenge, that he actually came up to London with
a full determination to be the death of him who had thus ruined
the peace of his beloved son, while the mother&rsquo;s mind was
not less distracted than that of the father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In
consequence of this, the father entered John Church&rsquo;s
meeting-house, with two loaded pistols, one in each pocket; but,
under the excess of agitation, he fainted away, and was carried
out of the place.</p>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>The
following will cast some light on the preceding:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:

<p>&ldquo;Last evening I had an interview with Clark&rsquo;s

mentioned to him respecting Church&rsquo;s conduct, and I find
the last night to be the worst.&nbsp; Likewise that he would have
committed the act had not Clark prevented him.&nbsp; The
particulars I told you when in London, but find them worse than
what I described to you.&nbsp; They are not able to be at any
expense; but if the gentlemen wish to prosecute, and to pay
Clark&rsquo;s expenses up to London, &amp;c. he will have no
objection to come when you please to send.&nbsp; I need only say
I wish you to inform the gentlemen, and give me a line.</p>

<p>In addition to the above testimonies, a very long narrative of
atrocities committed by <span class="smcap">John Church</span>;
while he resided at Banbury, has been written by a minister at
that place; but the facts are too disgusting and shocking to be
published.</p>
<p>In the month of April, 1813, a Mr. Webster, who was employed
in the house of Messrs. Evans and Co. eminent Hop Merchants, in
the Borough, having, this being the time the first public
exposure of Church&rsquo;s character took place, asserted his
readiness to prove Church&rsquo;s infamy, was immediately seized
upon by a fellow of the name of Holmes, and another creature of
the name of Shaw, a sort of attorney in St. George&rsquo;s
Fields, who had been employed by Church, and dragged to a
lock-up-house in the Borough, on a charge of riot, of which the
following account appeared in the Morning Chronicle.</p>
<p><i>Riots at the Obelisk</i>.&mdash;Tuesday, a Mr. Webster, who
is employed in the house of Messrs. Evans and Co. eminent
Hop-Merchants, in the Borough, <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>was charged at Union-Hall, by a
person of the name of Shaw, with committing a riot and a breach
of the peace, on Sunday morning, at the Obelisk, in St.
George&rsquo;s Fields, near the entrance of a chapel belonging to
a preacher named John Church.&nbsp; The magistrate said, that as
Mr. Birnie, who had, on a former day, heard another case similar
to this, was absent, they wished the case might be deferred until
next day, and desired Mr. Webster to attend accordingly.&nbsp;
The prosecutor observed, that it would be dangerous to allow Mr.
Webster to be at large, and desired that he might be kept in
custody or held to bail.&nbsp; The magistrate asked if there was
any person present ready to be bail for his appearance.&nbsp; Mr.
Robert Bell, the Editor of the <i>Weekly Despatch</i>, who
accompanied Mr. Webster as his friend, a housekeeper, in Lambeth,
said he was ready to bail him.&nbsp; The prosecutor then said, he
had also a very serious complaint to make against Mr. Bell, for
the article which he published in his last Sunday&rsquo;s
newspaper, respecting Mr. Church, and he had one of the papers in
his hand.&nbsp; Mr. Bell told the Magistrates that he was ready
to meet any complaint of this kind, that he conceived it to be
his duty, as one of the guardians of public liberty, and public
morals, to send forth the statement in question; that he could
prove the truth of every thing he had written and
published.&nbsp; The worthy magistrate then asked Mr. Webster if
he would promise, on his honour, to attend next day, which Mr.
Webster assured him he would do, and retired.&nbsp; It is
necessary to mention that Mr. Webster had been kept in a state of
imprisonment during the greater part of Sunday, and all Sunday
night.</p>
<p>April 7, 1813, Mr. Webster having appeared again before the
magistrates, disclosed, in the course of the examination, the
fact of Church having, some years since, made an attempt <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>of an
abominable nature, on the person of his younger brother, the
magistrate, struck with horror, immediately stopt all proceedings
against Mr. Webster, and desired his brother to be brought
forward.&nbsp; The office was cleared of all persons, except the
parties immediately concerned; the brother&rsquo;s deposition was
taken, and a warrant was issued for Church to appear there the
next day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, J. Church appeared, in consequence of the
warrant issued the day before for his apprehension on a charge of
abominable practices, attended by a number of his deluded
followers.&nbsp; Mr. W. Webster having deposed as to his attempts
on him, Church was ordered to find bail for his appearance at the
next Middlesex Sessions, and Mr. Webster bound over to
prosecute.&nbsp; The magistrate observed that from the length of
time which had elapsed since the offence had been committed, he
thought a jury would not feel justified in finding him
guilty.&nbsp; Mr. Johnston, a young gentleman of the law, who
attended for Mr. Webster, replied, that it was not the time for
them to discuss what was likely to be the verdict of a
jury;&mdash;that he had recommended Mr. Webster to prefer an
indictment against Church, and Mr. Webster had come to that
resolution; and whatever might be the result of the trial, the
evidence relating to the conduct of Church would be of that
disgusting nature as to stamp his name with eternal infamy and
disgrace.&nbsp; Church&rsquo;s attorney observed that it was a
conspiracy amongst another sect to ruin Mr. Church&rsquo;s
character.&nbsp; This Mr. Johnson denied and said that it was
merely a desire to bring him to merited punishment.&nbsp; Mr.
Johnston also said that if Mr. Church acted like a man of
prudence, and consulted his own interest, he would desist from
preaching until the indictment had been tried, as it would be the
means of preventing a breach of the peace, but <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>this he
declined; and Shaw; his attorney, said they should follow their
own advice.&nbsp; Mr. Johnston informed Church&rsquo;s attorney
that it was Mr. Webster&rsquo;s intention to indict, or bring an
action against him for an assault and false imprisonment.</p>
<p>On that very evening (incredible as it may appear) this very
man held to bail for trial on the most horrid charges, given on
oath, had the impudence to go into his chapel and preach to a
crowded audience.</p>
<p>On the 6th of June, 1813, the Grand Jury for the county of
Middlesex found a bill of indictment against John Church, for his
attempt, some years ago, on a lad, named Webster.&nbsp; On the
12th of July following, he was tried and
<i>acquitted</i>.&mdash;If any surprise is manifested at this
acquittal, let it be recollected, that this prosecution was
ordered by the magistrates, and did not <i>originate</i> with the
prosecutor, William Webster, on whom the abominable attempt was
alleged to have been made (now fourteen years ago).&nbsp; The
very mention of the attempt was a mere incidental circumstance
arising out of another proceeding then before the
Magistrates.&nbsp; Let the reader also take notice of the
following sentence:&mdash;&ldquo;The magistrate observed, that
from the length of time which had elapsed since the offence had
been committed, he thought a Jury would not feel justified in
finding him guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; This William Webster, therefore,
must be considered, in all respects, as an unwilling
prosecutor.&nbsp; He was supported only by one counsel, then of
young standing, (Mr. Adolphus,) who had to struggle against two
of the most able advocate (Messrs. Gurney and Alley) in the
criminal courts.&nbsp; It appears also that Webster gave his
evidence with embarrassment and trepidation, and that he suffered
himself to fall into some inconsistencies.&nbsp; With this
<i>solitary</i> and confused evidence, and after a
lapse&mdash;after a <i>silence</i> of <span
class="GutSmall">ELEVEN </span><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span><span class="GutSmall">YEARS</span>,
was it possible to suppose that a Jury would have found any man
guilty?&nbsp; But the verdict did not, in the slightest degree,
affect any of the numerous accusations, of a more recent date,
which have been made against John Church.&nbsp; From the reports
that had gone abroad, that he was addicted to certain abominable
propensities, gentlemen in the neighbourhood of the Surrey
Theatre, dreading the disgrace of pollution which Christianity
might suffer from the immoral character of any of its teachers,
investigated these rumours, and the following fact came to
light.&mdash;James Cook was released from his two year&rsquo;s
imprisonment, on the 21st of September, 1813, the landlord of the
infamous house in Vere-street.&nbsp; They accidentally met and
recognized each other, and a correspondence took place between
these <i>old</i> acquaintances, on the 13th of October
following.&nbsp; A <i>fac simile</i> of the letter has been
published, in Church&rsquo;s own hand-writing, offering Cook
assistance to set up another house, as may be
perceived:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lest I should not have time to call or converse with
you, as I shall not be alone to Day, I thought it But right to
Drop you a Line.&nbsp; I wish you all the success you can desire
in getting a house <i>fit for the business</i> in the public
line; and, as you had a great many acquaintances, they ought not
to fail you; if every one acted right, according to there
ability, I am sure you would soon accomplish it.&nbsp; As I am By
no means Rich, but rather embarrassed, I hope you will accept my
mite towards it, 1l. 1s. and you shall have another as
convenient, wishing you all prosperity,</p>

<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>There
is another letter bearing the two-penny post mark of the 20th of
October.&mdash;It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following is a narrative which Cook has given of his
acquaintance with <i>Parson Church</i>; and which was taken down
from his own dictation by Mr. E&mdash; B&mdash;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In May, 1810, I was in company with Mr.
Yardley and another young man by the name of Ponder.&nbsp; I
found after that the said Ponder was a drummer in the Guards; I
called at a house in the London-road, where I saw Mr. Church the
first time in my life: there was at this house about twelve or
fourteen altogether, drinking gin, and Mr. Church handed me a
glass of the same, which I took; Church behaved very polite to
me, and said what a fine fellow I was; he pressed me very much to
stop and get tea with them, for he said he would call and see me
when I was settled in the house in Vere-street.&nbsp; I stopped a
little while, and was about to leave them, when Church said I
should not go before I had tea, and flung down, a dollar; and a
man, by the name of Gaiscoin, took the money and went for the tea
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>and other
things, but I would not stay: Church came out of the room with
me, and walked with me as far as the turnpike; there he met
another gentleman, which I never saw before, and I went on and
left him for that time; I think it was six or eight days.&nbsp; I
went to live at the Swan, and saw Church again; he came about
three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and Mr. Yardley accosted
him, &ldquo;Parson, what are you come to see the
chapel?&rdquo;&nbsp; He said &ldquo;Yes, and to preach
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Church asked me how I was; I said I was not
very well: he asked me why I went away in that shy manner; I told
him he was a stranger to me, and I did not like to be intruding
on strange people: he said I was shy&mdash;he did not know what
to make of me; he also pressed me very much to take a walk with
him, but I declined it: he said I must go, but I still declined,
and did not go with him; he staid some time, and joined the
company in the back parlour&mdash;persons by the name of Miss Fox
and Miss Kitty Cambrick was among them, and the Queen of
Bohemia.&nbsp; As Mr. Church was going away, he came to the bar
and spoke to me, and said I must take something to drink, which I
did, and he paid for it, and left the house for that time.&nbsp;
In a few days he called again, in the afternoon, and there was
not many people there; he asked if Yardley was at home; I said he
was not; he said he was very sorry for it; I asked him what he
wanted; he said he came on purpose for me to take a walk with
him, but I did not go: he said he would wait until Yardley came
in.&nbsp; Church said I should do him a great favour if I would
take a walk with him; I would not go&mdash;he still pressed me
very much to go: I said I would if he would wait till I had
cleaned myself: he waited more than two hours for me; I went to
sleep because I would not go with him; and in the mean time he
waited so long that he was tired; he sent the waiter to call <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>me, which he
did, and said the Parson wanted me, and had been waiting two
hours for me; I said, let him wait, for I should not come; he
returned, and said if I would but speak to him, he should go away
happy; I found I could not get rid of him&mdash;I went down
stairs; he said, well, sir, I hope your nap has done you good; I
said, I don&rsquo;t know, don&rsquo;t bother me.&nbsp; He said I
was very cross to him; I told him there was other men without me;
if he wanted to preach, not to preach to me about
crossness.&nbsp; He said, well, if that was the case, he was very
sorry he had offended me; I told him he had not offended me nor
pleased me; but as I was not well, the less any one talked to me
the better I liked it; he said, if I was but friends with him,
and shake hands with him, he should go away happy.&nbsp; Mr.
Yardley said, he never see such a fellow as I was, for I had
affronted every body that came to the house.&nbsp; I then shook
hands with the Parson, for at that time I did not know his
name.&nbsp; He shook hands with me, and we had something to
drink, and Mr. Church paid for it and went away.&nbsp; I never
saw him till I came out of Newgate; I was talking to Mr. and Mrs.
Holloway, and telling them there was a Parson somewhere about St
George&rsquo;s Fields, but his name I did not know.&nbsp; He
asked me if I should know him if I saw him, I said I should; by
that I went to the chapel and saw Mr. Church, and then I asked
the people what was the Parson&rsquo;s name; they told me his
name was Church.&nbsp; I said he ought to be ashamed of himself
to preach there, a ******** and rascal, and left the place, and
went home in the greatest pains I ever felt in my life, and was
resolved to see him, which I did the next day, and give him one
of the hand-bills; and the manner he received me, was like a
young man would his sweetheart;&mdash;I began my conversation;
Well, sir, I suppose you do not know me?&nbsp; He said he <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>did
not.&nbsp; I said my name was Cook, that kept the Swan, in
Vere-street.&nbsp; He said he thought so, but was not sure: he
said why did I not call before and shake hands with a-body.&nbsp;
I told him I did not know where he lived, nor I did not know his
name until I went to the chapel and found him out.&nbsp; He told
me not to make it known that he ever came to my house, for he and
Rowland Hill had daggers drawn, and that he should be obliged to
indite Hill to clear up his character, and for God&rsquo;s sake
do not expose me.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Here the narrative breaks

</blockquote>
<p>As an orator, he delivers himself in a full, clear,
articulate, tone of voice; but, to criticise his style, or
analyse the <i>substance</i> of his discourse, would be a
fruitless labour; it would be like dissecting a cobweb.&nbsp;
Unmeaning rhapsodies and unconnected sentences, through which the
faintest gleam of morality is not to be traced, must, from their
evanescent nature, set the powers of recollection at defiance,
they even escape the lash of contempt.&nbsp; But, to gratify the
reader, the following <i>notes</i> of a <span
class="GutSmall">SERMON</span> was taken down in short-hand as he
delivered it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God is frequently going forth, and we also
are often going to the window to look for him; the more <i>vile I
am</i> made to appear to the <i>world</i>, the more God will
<i>assist</i> me.&nbsp; Every citizen is a free-born.&nbsp; Many
have wondered how I could go through so much trouble.&nbsp; There
have been a great many that have wished to see me&mdash;I can
inform them, I had much rather they had wished to see
Christ.&nbsp; People may be laughed at for being fools, but, you
may depend upon it, the more God will like them.&nbsp; All that
believe not will certainly be damned.&nbsp; The duties of
christianity are not to be preached to an ungodly world.&nbsp;
John Church is very much spoken of, but they had much better
speak of Jesus.&nbsp; The people of the established church feel
no spiritual joy.&nbsp; Spiritual discourse is enlivening <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>to the
senses. &amp;c.&nbsp; The bread of life is not to be given away
to <i>dogs</i>.&nbsp; I am not going to turn auctioneer, but I am
going to inform you, that, next Lord day, I am going to publish a
book, proving that God, the Son, and the Spirit, are all one
great God.&nbsp; My sermon will be good news and comfort to all
poor sinners.&nbsp; Satan and all his spirits never sleeps; the
power of life and death is only in the hands of our Lord Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; Devils are allowed to harass the people of God day
and night,&mdash;no wonder they perplex those they can&rsquo;t
destroy.&nbsp; People are mostly liable to fall, in their first
love, into awful heresies and temptation.&nbsp; All the
Lord&rsquo;s people do not see into the glory of my
text&mdash;&rsquo;tis like a jewel in a rock of
adamant.&mdash;The worst sin was the murdering of God&rsquo;s
saints.&nbsp; When I sit in darkness the Lord will be a light
unto me.&nbsp; I am never tired of preaching, and, I believe, my
dear brethren are never tired of hearing me.&nbsp; Many men laugh
at the doctrine of the new birth&mdash;are there not many learned
doctors that know nothing of it?&nbsp; Let a man come under any
circumstances, I will receive him&mdash;Don&rsquo;t laugh at the
doctrine of inspiration; be wise, it has often been preached by
our church.&nbsp; If every one that is saved should be as bright
as the sun, what a place heaven must be, where there will be so
many millions!&nbsp; Angels beckon me away, and Christ bids me
come.&nbsp; The sight of Christ, you may depend on&rsquo;t, will
be worth suffering for.&nbsp; O that I had the voice of an
archangel, I would indeed do wonders.&nbsp; I doubt the
superiority of one angel over another in heaven&mdash;Christ is
entirely independent of or with God.&nbsp; We must have the
spirit of God before we are his people.&nbsp; Believe in the
predestination of eternal life, but not in eternal death; people
that suffer were before-hand predestined so to do <i>by
God</i>.&nbsp; Bad or horrid is the religion of a proud
pharisee.&nbsp; The <span class="GutSmall">MOB</span> is <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>seldom
stirred up but through priests; there is now a case of the very
kind: envy bursts forth through jealous and envious neighbouring
<i>priests</i>, and published by <i>deists</i>, there can be
nothing to fear; and, I verily believe; that any thing prayed for
to Christ will certainly be granted, as has always been the case
with me.&nbsp; Let us for ever endeavour to turn every thing,
whether good or bad, into good.&nbsp; I do not care who hears me,
whether <i>God</i> or <i>man</i>, <i>friends</i> or <i>foes</i>,
<i>devils</i> or <i>angels</i>, or any thing else; and let them
call me an Antinomian again if they please.&nbsp; There must be
spiritual life in the soul.&nbsp; I do not believe that God begot
Jesus Christ&mdash;they say too that Joseph was an impostor, at
this very day:&mdash;everything that is done against the church
is done against Christ; also, that which is done against Christ
is done against the church; and anything done against the people
of God is done against Christ.&nbsp; It is a most blessed thing
that we can throw our burthens upon Christ.&nbsp; That religion
that is preached by the people of God is God himself.&nbsp; There
can be no going forth until the spirit of God has entered.&nbsp;
The Lord Jesus Christ and the people of God are all one.&nbsp;
Christ has no sorrow but the people of God must sympathise with
him; and the people of God have no affliction but that Christ
sympathises with them.&nbsp; This monster&mdash;when he was about
to preach, would frequently say to his
<i>favorites</i>;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I am going tip &rsquo;em a
gammoning story, my old women would believe the moon to be made
of green cheese, If I was to tell them so.&nbsp; And I must tell
them something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In consequence of a respectable young tradesman, in the
Borough, Mr. E&mdash; B&mdash;, who was one of his hearers,
becoming disgusted with his hypocrisy, and some attempts he had
made upon him, leaving him altogether, he wrote the following
beastly epistles:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Had
this wretch received a classical education, one might suppose he
had been writing a paraphrase on Virgil&rsquo;s eclogue,
beginning with the line&mdash;<i>Formasum</i> Pastor Corydon
<i>Ardebat Alexin</i>.</p>
<p>Copy of a letter, written by the Rev. John Church, Minister of
the Obelisk-Chapel, Blackfriars&rsquo;-Road, to Mr. E&mdash;
B&mdash;, Rodney-Street, Kent-Street, Borough, dated March 3,
1809.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Ned,</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the best blessings be yours in life and in death,
while the sweet sensations of real genuine disinterested
friendship rules every power of your mind, body, and soul.&nbsp;
I can only say I wish you as much captivated with sincere
friendship as I am; but we all know our own feelings best.&nbsp;
Friendship, those best of names,&mdash;affection, those sweetest
power,&mdash;like some powerful charm that overcomes the
mind.&nbsp; I could write much on this subject, but dare not
trust you with what I could say, much as I esteem you.&mdash;You
would consider it unmanly and quite effeminate; and having
already proved what human nature is, I must conceal even these
emotions of love which I feel.&nbsp; I wish I had the honour of
being loved by you as much and in as great a degree as I do
you.&nbsp; Sometimes the painful thought of a separation
overpowers me; many are now trying at it; but, last night, I told
the persons that called on me that, let them insinuate what they
would, I would never sacrifice my dear Ned to the shrine of any
other friend on earth; and that them you did not like, him should
have none of my company at all.&nbsp; I find, dear Ned, many are
using all their power to part us; but I hope it will prove in
vain on your side: the effect all this has upon me is to make me
love you ten times more than ever.&nbsp; I wish opposition may
have the same effect upon you in this particular; but I fear
not.&nbsp; However, I am confident if you love <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>me now, or
any other time, my heart will ever be sat upon you, nor can I
forget you till death.&nbsp; Your leaving of me will break my
heart,&mdash;bring down my poor mind with sorrow to the grave,
and wring from my eyes the briny tears, while my busy meddling
memory will call to remembrance the few pleasant hours we spent
together.&nbsp; I picture to my imagination the affecting scene,
the painful thought.&nbsp; I must close the affecting subject;
&rsquo;tis more than my feelings are able to bear.&mdash;My heart
is full, my mind is sunk.&mdash;I shall be better when I have
vented out my grief.&nbsp; Stand fast, my dearest Ned, to me: I
shall to you whether you do to me or no; and may we be pardoned,
justified, and brought more to the knowledge of Christ.&nbsp; O
help me to sing&mdash;</p>
<p>When thou, my righteous judge, shall come<br />
To fetch thy ransom&rsquo;d people home,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May I among them stand;<br />
Let such a worthless worm as I,<br />
That sometimes am afraid to die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be found at thy right hand.</p>
<p>I love to be among them now,<br />
Before thy gracious feet to bow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though vilest of them all;<br />
But, can I bear the piercing thought,<br />
What if my name should be left out,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou for them should call.</p>
<p>Learn these two verses by heart, and then I will write two
more, as they are expressions of mind, fears, sensations, and
desires.&mdash;I must close, I long to see your dear face again,
I long for Sunday morning, till then God bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I remain unalterably thy dear,<br />
thy loving friend.<br />

<p>Another letter was received by Mr. E&mdash; B&mdash; on the
15th of March, 1809, from Church, without a date, as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this thy kindness to thy once professed much loved
friend, surely I never, never, did deserve such cruel treatment
at your hands; why <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>not speak to me last night in James-Street when you
heard me call, stop! stop! Ned! do, pray do; but cruel, cruel,
Ned, deaf to all intreaties&mdash;O why was I permitted to pass
the door of Mr. Gibbons when you and West were coming out.&nbsp;
Why was I permitted to tramp up and down the New Cut after you; I
only wanted to speak one bitter, heart-breaking, painful,
distressing, word, farewell: I only wanted to pour my sorrows
into your bosom, to shake hands with you once more, but I was
denied this indulgence.&nbsp; I never, never, thought you would
deceive me&mdash;O, what an unhappy man am I; the thing that I
most feared is come upon me, no excuse can justify such apparent
duplicity; O, my distress is great indeed.&nbsp; O my God! what
shall I do?&nbsp; O Christ!&nbsp; O God! support me in this
trying hour, what a night am I passing through; I cannot sleep,
its near three o&rsquo;clock; alas! sleep is departed, how great
my grief, how bitter my sorrows, the loss of my character is
nothing to the loss of one dearer to me than anything else.&nbsp;
O let me give vent to tears; but I am too, too, much distressed
to cry; O that I could.&nbsp; I feel this like a dagger; never,
never, can I forgive the unhappy instrument of my distress in
Charlotte-street.&nbsp; Why did my dear friend Edward deceive
me?&nbsp; O how my mind was eased on Wednesday night; alas, how
distressed on Thursday.&nbsp; I have lost my only bosom friend,
nearest, dearest, friend, bosom from bosom torn, how
horrid!&nbsp; Ah, dear Suffolk-court, never surely can I see you
again.&nbsp; How the Philistines will triumph; there, so would we
have it: how Ebeir, Calvin, Thompson, Edwards, Bridgman, all will
rejoice, and I have lost my friend, my all in this world, except
the other part of myself, my wife, and poor babes; never did I
expect this from my dear E&mdash; B&mdash;.&nbsp; O for a calm
mind, that I might sleep till day-light; but <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>no, this I
fear will be denied me.&nbsp; How can I bear the piercing
thought, parted; a dreadful word, worst of sensations, the only
indulgence, the only confident, the only faithful, the only kind
and indulgent, sympathising, friend, to lose you.&nbsp; O what a
stroke; O what a cut, what shall I do for matter on Sunday; O
that I could get some one to preach for me; how can I lift up my
head.&nbsp; O sir, if you have a grain of affection left for me,
do intreat of God to support me; this is a worse affliction than
the loss of my character nine months ago.&nbsp; A man cannot lose
his character twice.&nbsp; O, I did think you knew better; I did
think I had found one in you that I could not find elsewhere; but
no, the first object presented to you, seen suddenly, gained your
mind, gained your affections; and I, poor, unhappy, distressed,
I, am left to deplore your loss.&nbsp; O for submission, but I am
distressed; woe is me.&nbsp; O that I had never, never, known
you, then I should never feel what I do; but I thank you for your
company hitherto, I have enjoyed it four months exactly, but this
is over for ever; miserable as I am, I wish you well for ever,
for ever.&nbsp; I write in the bitterness of my soul which I
feel.&nbsp; May you never be cursed with the feelings I possess
as long as you live.&nbsp; What a day I have before me!&nbsp; I
cannot go out of my house till Sunday morning.&nbsp; How can I
conceal my grief from my dear wife?&mdash;how shall I hide
it?&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;I am miserable, nor can I
surmount the shock at all.&nbsp; I have no friend to pour out my
sorrows to now, I wish I had; I am sorry you are so easily duped
by any to answer their purposes: my paper is full, my paper is
full, my heart is worse; God help me!&nbsp; Lord God support
me!&nbsp; What shall I do, dear God!&nbsp; O Lord have mercy on
me!&nbsp; I must close; this comes from your ever loving, but
distressed,</p>

<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>In
addition to the confession made to Mrs. Hunter, the following
confessional letter from Church, was sent to the great surprise
of the Rev. Mr. L&mdash;, two days after the offence had been
committed.&nbsp; It appears that Church was but very slightly
known to the above gentleman, in consequence of some money
transactions having passed between them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Surely
upon the reception of this short note you will say, ah,
<i>Church</i> is like all the rest of the parsons, promise much
and do little, yea nothing: to your note I can only with a pained
heart reply <i>I cannot indeed</i>&mdash;I can scarcely write
this note, my soul is too deeply pierced.&nbsp; About eight or
nine years ago Dr. Draper left the church in the Borough and God
opened Chapel-court for me, many attended and have been blest,
now a singular providence, but a most distressing one, has
occurred to take me shortly from my dear, dear family and beloved
congregation.&nbsp; But God has sent Mr. L&mdash; to preach all
the truth to my poor dispersed flock, at least so it appears to
me, and I would do all the good to promote the success of Mr.
L&mdash; that my poor people might not be starved till I return
to them in peace, which may be many months.&nbsp; My heart is
broken, my enemies have ruined me at last, and I shall never,
never surmount it, an unpleasant affair happening at Vauxall, is
added too, and I must take the consequences: no arm can help,
relieve, or deliver, but the Lord&rsquo;s, and I feel persuaded
the Lord will <i>not</i>: judge my feelings if you can.&nbsp; I
shall secretly come and hear you, to get all the good I can to a
heart deprest, disconsolate, and full of woe.&nbsp; Oh, the joy
of my enemies!&nbsp; Oh the distress of my friends!&nbsp; Oh, my
poor heart!&nbsp; Let a sigh go up to God for me when you
can.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>The
following bad character has been given of Church by Mr. and Mrs.
Gee, of the New Cut, who keep a cake-shop, where he once
lodged:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr Church, the minister, lodged at our
house a year and a half, and left last year at Lady Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in hopes that we were about to have a godly
praying minster in our house; and to be sure the first night he
had somewhat like a prayer, and that once afterwards were the
only times he ever went to family prayer in our house.&nbsp; Nor
could they have any prayer, as he would be frequently out almost
all hours of the night, and would lie in bed till ten in the
morning.&nbsp; Several times he and his wife would have
skirmishings and fightings between themselves, while the children
would be left to run about the streets out of school hours, and
allowed to keep company with children that would swear in our
hearing most shockingly.&nbsp; His children were always left to
be very dirty, and would be sent sometimes three or four times in
a morning for spirituous liquors of all sorts.&nbsp; As for
reading good books, or even the Bible, he scarce ever thought of
it, but would spend a deal of his time in loose and vain talk, in
walking about, and fawning upon young men, that was his chief
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sundays and working days were all alike to them, for
they would send out to buy liquors, and whatever else they
wanted, on Sundays as well as other days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house would be frequently more like a playhouse (I
might say a bawdy house) than a minister&rsquo;s house, were a
set of young people would come and behave more indecently than
ought to be mentioned.&nbsp; Even one Sunday morning they made
such an uproar as that they broke one of the windows, after that
they would go with him to his chapel, and, after that, he would
give the sacrament to such disorderly people, let their
characters be ever so loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always ready to go fast <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>enough out to
dinner or supper where he could get good eating and drinking, but
poor people might send to him from their sick bed times and times
before he would come to them.&nbsp; Seeing so much of his
inconsistencies and shocking filthiness in their rooms, (though
they always paid their rent,) we were determined to give them
warning to quit our house, and we do not think that a worse man
or woman ever came into any house before, especially as Mr.
Church pretended to preach the gospel; such hypocrites are much
worse than others, and, besides this, we never heard a man tell
lies so fast in all our lives.&nbsp; It is a great grief to us
that ever we went to hear him preach, or suffered him to stop so
long in our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">George and
Frances Gee</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears from the testimony of George Tarrier, and James
Russell, of Redcross-street; of Richard Jessop, of Castle-street;
and William Williams of the Mint; that the <i>Rev. John
Church</i>, on the 16th of November, 1809, also attended at the
funeral of Richard Oakden, a clerk in the Bank, who was hung
before Newgate, for an abominable offence, on 14th November,
1809.&nbsp; This <i>pious</i> minister and his partizans returned
to the Hat and Feathers, Gravel-lane, kept by a Mr. Richardson,
where the funeral set out from, to partake of a jovial
dinner.&nbsp; His conduct here, it seems, was beyond
description.</p>
<p>It is averred, that his wife, upon hearing the infamy of his
conduct took to drinking, to avoid reflection, which soon
occasioned her death.&nbsp; But, within the last three months
since, he has been charged with the above detestable offence, in
order (we presume under the mask of hypocrisy,) to rescue, in
some degree, his character from the public odium with which it
had been marked, he has been induced to marry a respectable
woman, who kept a seminary for young ladies at Hammersmith.&nbsp;
The verdict <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>of &ldquo;Guilty&rdquo; had been scarcely pronounced,
when the relatives of the children, with the greatest promptitude
possible, took them all away from the said school.</p>
<p>Some time previous to the commission of the offence for which
Church has been at last convicted he made an attempt, in the open
street, on the person of a poor Frenchman, who had him conveyed
to the watchhouse, where a long examination took place, but the
proof not being very conclusive, the affair was hushed up.</p>
<p>Since his conviction, Church has resided at the house of <i>a
friend</i>, where <i>his followers</i> are admitted to see him on
producing a card signed by himself, on which are inscribed
certain texts of scripture.&nbsp; Will this wretch never cease
blaspheming the holy scriptures by his appropriation of them!</p>
<p>It may not be improper to state one of the tricks made use of
to threw the prosecutor off his guard.&nbsp; A limb of the law,
it appears, of the <i>Jewish</i> persuasion, <i>gratuitously</i>
offered to conduct the prosecution for the young man; but upon a
refusal being given him, on account of Mr. <span
class="smcap">Harmer</span> being selected for that purpose, it
was ultimately discovered that this <i>philanthropic</i>
Israelite had been exerting himself towards exculpating Church,
with all the ingenuity he was master of in his defence, from the
heinous offence alleged against him.&nbsp; The &ldquo;laws
delay&rdquo; was resorted to, but only to put off the trial till
the next assizes, but the expenses materially increased, as a
means of deterring the prosecutor from proceeding.&nbsp; It is,
however, lamentable to observe, that the charges in bringing such
a wretch to justice, should amount to eighty or ninety
pounds!</p>
<p>From the acknowledgement of this monster himself, the profits
of this <i>precious</i> recepticle produced him from &pound;1000
to &pound;1200 annually.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>At
length, this precious hypocrite, who has so long set all decency
at defiance, by public preaching, notwithstanding his diabolical
well known propensities, has been found guilty of the crime he
has so long (and so numerously) been charged with.&nbsp; Much as
it might be wished that such a monster, under the disguise of
that sacred habit, which at all times is entitled to reverence,
should be consigned with his crimes to oblivion.&nbsp; But such
suppression would be doing a serious injury to public
morals.&nbsp; Delicacy at all times ought to be a paramount
consideration, but there are cases in which a great deal more
injury both to morals and liberty may arise from the suppression
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>than the
exposure of indecencies.&nbsp; This we apprehend to be one of
that sort, and great care has been taken to avoid entering into
any disgusting particulars.&nbsp; It is due to the community at
large that such a dangerous character should be exposed to
society, and it is equally important to that sacred body, who can
only rise or fall in public estimation from their good
conduct.</p>
<p>He will be brought up the first day of next term to receive
judgement in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench.&nbsp; Mr. Gurney we
understand, although he so ably and eloquently defended the
guilty monster, Church, undertook his cause with the greatest
reluctance.</p>

<h3>THE REV. J. L. GARRETT&rsquo;S VINDICATION.</h3>
<p><i>Letter addressed by the Rev.</i> J. L. <span
class="smcap">Garrett</span>, <i>Professor of Natural
Philosophy</i>, <i>&amp;c. to the Publisher of a Six-penny
Pamphlet</i>, <i>intituled</i>, &ldquo;<i>The Life and Trial
of</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">John Church</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>As bigotry, superstition, and misguided zeal, those dreadful
sources of violence, wasting, and destruction, which once too
often actuated both my tongue and pen, have now, through divine
Grace, for several years, ceased <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>to form any trait in my deportment;
you will, I trust, allow me the humble claim, of having that
erased from your pamphlet, which a better use of my reason has so
evidently erased from my conduct.</p>
<p>Rest assured, I most sincerely wish success to every laudable
effort you can exert to suppress vice, but particularly vices so
extremity disgraceful to human nature&mdash;but have the
goodness, Sir, to understand that I never, in my life, was what
your pamphlet calls me, a friend or acquaintance of the person
you allude to, nor <i>never</i> had any thing <i>to do with
him</i>, but what was <i>forced on me</i> by <i>his own
insinuations</i>, which principally were carried on with some of
my people in Lant-street while I was out of town.</p>
<p>I also remark that I had no hand in getting him into Banbury;
and can only say, would to God that those things which drove him
out had been followed by sincere repentance, then I think I
should have been one of the first to have administered the
consolation of the gospel; but as things are, I shall leave the
detection and suppression of vice in abler hands than my own,
with this prayer, that &ldquo;That truly wretched man, may yet be
brought with sincere repentance to the feet of Jesus, obtain
mercy, and, under the influence and operation of the holy spirit,
gain the completest mastery over a nature so awfully depraved,
and thus prove that nothing is too hard for God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>P.S.&nbsp; Since I sent my note to the press, my friends have
manifested some objections to the gentleness of my remonstrances,
under circumstances so truly aggravating, as that of having my
name at all mentioned in the details of such a filthy concern;
and as I have occasionally the instruction of noblemen&rsquo;s
sons, of the first respectability, I must, under every
consideration, insist on its being immediately
withdrawn.&mdash;But, if humanity should dispose you to dispense
with my name, in this instance, without further trouble, it shall
certainly be at your service, whenever you feel disposed
seriously to argue the possibility of one bigot in a hundred
being brought to the right use of his reason.</p>
<p>You will, I trust, excuse the shortness of this address, as my
own paralytic debility, accompanied with a death in my family,
which has not yet advanced to interment, forbids me to say
more.</p>

<h3>CHURCH BURNT IN EFFIGY!</h3>
<p>We are informed by a most respectable follower of and believer
in, John Church, one who gave evidence on his trial in his
favour, and whose name we will, if required, give up to satisfy
the most credulous of its authenticity, that on Monday evening
last, after a visit to his residence, adjoining the Tabernacle,
in the Borough-road, he returned to Rock-House, Hammersmith,
which he had no sooner entered than the mob, having gained a
knowledge of his being there, attacked with mud, filth, and other
missile annoyances, and presently broke all the windows,
expressing their indignation at Church&rsquo;s most abominable
atrocities; meanwhile, by groans, hisses, and all sorts of
execrations, they having previously drest up an effigy of him, in
a black silk gown, with a painted <i>Church</i> placed <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>on each side,
that the most dull might be informed whom it was meant to
represent, paraded with it all through the village, when they
finally burnt it to typify those <i>Gomorrah fires</i>, which, in
the absence of a timely and sincere repentance, we are taught to
believe will be the lot of the original in that place where fire
is never quenched.&nbsp; Of this repentance we are sorry to
observe no signs at present, but we <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>trust the forth-coming punishment
(most probably <i>solitary confinement</i>) will give him leisure
to reflect on his atrocities and awaken him to a due sense of
their enormities: truly happy shall we be to hear that the
retribution of an earthly judge has shewn him the greater danger
in which he stands with regard to his heavenly one.</p>

My dear Johnny, in h&mdash;,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As when <i>clad in a minister&rsquo;s gown</i>.</p>
<p class="poetry"><i>We are hypocrites both</i>,<br />
To deceive nothing loth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In short we&rsquo;re just form&rsquo;d for each
other;<br />
Then <i>come Johnny</i>, <i>do</i>,<br />
<i>Or I must come for you</i>,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, come to Old Nick, your dear brother.</p>
<p class="poetry">You shall be treated well,<br />
Dearest Johnny, in h&mdash;,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You on <i>sulphur and brimstone</i> shall feast;<br
/>
We&rsquo;ll with <i>fires keep you warm</i>,<br />
And do all things to charm;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As befits so illustrious a guest.</p>
<p class="poetry">In h&mdash;, John, you&rsquo;ll meet<br />
Many friends from <i>Vere-Street</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which quite cosey and handy will be;<br />
For their <i>chaplain</i> in h&mdash;<br />
You may be, John, as well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As on earth you us&rsquo;d one time, be.</p>
<p class="poetry">True, John, scripture you quote,<br />
Like a parrot, by rote,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So too many other men do;<br />
And then &rsquo;tis well known<br />
Almost to every one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I, the devil, can quote scripture too.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thy locks all so lank,<br />
And thy chops all so blank,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy hoarse nasal twangings to boot;<br />
Finely humm&rsquo;d all the folks;<br />
But adieu to such jokes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For, like me, you&rsquo;ve now shewn <i>cloven
foot</i>.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
